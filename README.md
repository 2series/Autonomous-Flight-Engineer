A flying vehicle is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air.

[Backyard Flyer]()
***Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!***

This project, we have entered the **"Hello world!"** of drone programming as we write event-driven code that causes a  quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

**My Solution**
- [Solution](Backyard-Flyer/backyard_flyer_solution.py)



[3D Motion Planning]()
This project, I apply what I've learned about **3D motion planning** from the *Planning* section classes to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

**My Solution**
- [Solution](/Motion-Planning/planning_utils_solution.py)
- [Solution Write-up](/Motion-Planning/FCND-Motion_Planning.pdf)

[Building A Controller]()
This project, we implemented a controller for a quadrotor in C++. Experimented on building **PID Controller** and **3D Dynamics** of a quadcopter.

**My Solution**
- [Solution](/Controls/src/QuadControl.cpp)
- [Solution Write-up](/Controls/report2.pdf)

[Building an Estimator]()
This project we implemented an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions. Experimented on **Kalman Filters** **Estimation and Localization**.

**My Solution**
- [Solution](/Estimation/src/QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp)
- [Solution Write-up](/Estimation/report/report.md)
